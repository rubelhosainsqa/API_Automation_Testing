# REST API automation testing by using Robot Framework

## Overview
This project provides automated testing for various API endpoints to ensure they meet expected behavior. Mainly I tried to operate the API CRUD operation with test assertion and also validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of APIs.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or later
- Robot Framework 7

## How to run
- Clone this project
- Install Python
- Install Robot Framework (e.g., pip install robotframework, pip install robotframework-requests, pip install -U robotframework-jsonlibrary)

## API Documentation
- https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25355745/2s9XxwxEec

## Report Summary
- At first need to run the test script file (All_Test_Cases.robot)
- Then open the report file to check all the assertion results with log (report.html)
